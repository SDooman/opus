The Opus Education Platform
============================

## Motivation

Opus is a sheet music writing application, with an interface designed for new musicians to learn the early tenets of theory. The code in this repository was written by the Opus team comprised of Samuel Dooman, Peter Bowden, and Nick DeMarco during the summer of 2015, through the B-Lab Entreprenurial Accellerator at Brown University. The application is currently considered to be in beta, though it has been placed on indefinite hiatus.

Local Setup
============================

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:SDooman/opus-interface.git
cd ./opus-interface
```

Git Workflow
============================

* Create a feature branch -- `git checkout -b your-feature-branch`
* Push all commits to origin/your-feature-branch at github
* When your branch meets the requirements to merge against development branch,
 use `hub pull-request -b develop`
* Once your branch is discussed & approved:
* Rebase your branch -- `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/develop`
* Squash your branch -- `git rebase -i origin/develop`
* Merge branch -- `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git merge your-feature-branch`
* push your branch -- `git push`
* (Optional) Delete your branch using `git branch -d your-feature-branch && git push origin :your-feature-branch`

Whenever you commit changes to a branch, use the following
structure to maximize the readibility of our repo's git logs.

`git commit -a -m "[*x*] *y* *z*"`

*x* is your initials (ex. [SD])

*y* is one of the following present tense verbs describing the commit:
* tests - writes tests for feature's functionality
* implements - fills out stencils of methods for target functionality
* finishes - feature is tested and implemented
* stencils - creates classes and method signatures for target functionality
* fixes - fixes a bug in particular feature
* refactors - redesigns program structure to remove technical debt
* hacks - implements, but with known technial debt
* edits - reserved for changing project files without code (README.md, .gitignore)

*z* is the desired feature/group of files that implement a feature

Below is an example:

`git commit -a -m "[SD] implements audio playback "`
